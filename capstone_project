Original dataset can be tracked at https://layoffs.fyi/

-I used Excel spreadsheets for cleaning the data. 
-I removed Date_Added, Source, and List_of_Employees_Laid_Off columns as they were not needed for my analysis. 
-I renamed columns to be all lowercase.
-I changed the date column to the date datatype. 
-I changed laid_off_count to an integer datatype.
-I filled null values in the laid_off_count, percentage, funds_raised columns with 0. 
-I removed one row from the company Homebound as there were no values for laid_off_count, percentage, or date.
-I extracted the year from the date column and made a new column titled year. 

Questions that came to mind when looking at this dataset:
1. How many countries are included in this dataset?
2. How many companies are included in this dataset?
3. How many industries are included in this dataset?
4. What were the top 10 companies with layoffs each year?
5. What were the top 10 industries with the layoffs each year?
6. What were the top 10 locations within the United States with layoffs?
7. What was the average number of layoffs per industry?
8. What was the total number of layoffs by stage in descending order?

I did Data Exploration using SQL.
